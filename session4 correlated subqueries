1.List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2.Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE continent = 'Europe' and  gdp/population >
     (SELECT gdp/population FROM world
      WHERE name='United Kingdom')
      
3. List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. 
Order by name of the country.

select 
name,continent
from world
where continent in (
select continent from world where name = 'Argentina' or name = 'Australia'
)
order by name


4.Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

select
name,population
from world
where population > (select population from world where name = 'Canada') and 
population < (select population from world where name = 'Poland')

5.Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. 
Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.
Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
Functions: concat

select
name,concat(round(population / (select population from world where name = 'Germany' )*100,0),'%')
from world
where continent = 'Europe'


6.Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] 
(Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select 
name 
from world
where gdp > ALL ( select gdp from world where gdp >0 and continent ='Europe' )

7.Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

######Using correlated subqueries########


SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)
          
         
8.First country of each continent (alphabetically)

select 
continent,name
from world t1
where name <= ALL (select name from world t2 where t1.continent = t2.continent )

9.Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. 
Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. 
Show name, continent and population.

select
name,continent, population
from world 
where continent in (
select continent from world t1 
where (select max(population) from world t2 where t1.continent =t2.continent)   <= 25000000
) 

10.Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). 
Give the countries and continents.

select name,continent
from world t1
where population/3 > ALL (
select population from world t2
where t1.continent = t2.continent and t1.name <> t2.name
)
