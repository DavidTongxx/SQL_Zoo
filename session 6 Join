The JOIN operation
https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation

1.The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. 
The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. 
To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

SELECT 
matchid,
player
 FROM goal
  WHERE teamid ='GER'
  
2.From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. 
Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.
Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. 
We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
 
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game where id = 1012
  

3.The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.
Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.

SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
where goal.teamid = 'GER'

4.Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
SELECT team1,team2,player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (game.id=goal.matchid)
where goal.player like 'Mario%'

5.Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid,coach, gtime
  FROM goal join eteam on goal.teamid = eteam.id
 WHERE gtime<=10

6.List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

select
mdate,teamname 
from 
game g join eteam e on g.team1 = e.id 
where coach = 'Fernando Santos'

7.List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

select
player
from 
goal join game on matchid=id
where stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

8.Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.

SELECT DISTINCT(player)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid =id
WHERE (team1 ='GER' or team2 ='GER') and teamid <>'GER'

9.Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
SELECT teamname, count(*) as goals
  FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
 group by teamname
 
10.Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.

select
stadium,
count(*) as numb_goals
from goal join game on goal.matchid = game.id
group by stadium

11.For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid,mdate, count(*) as num_goals
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
group by 1,2


12.For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

select 
matchid,
mdate,
count(*) as numb_goals
from 
goal join game on goal.matchid = game.id
where teamid = 'GER'
group by 1,2

13.List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown.
This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

(NOT every game will have a goal)
(game table will be a main table)

select
mdate,
team1,
sum(case when teamid = team1 then 1 else 0 end) score1,
team2,
sum(case when teamid = team2 then 1 else 0 end) score2
from game left join goal on matchid =id
group by 1,2,4
order by 1,matchid,2,4
